#Loops and Lists

#build and print out various Lists

#list is teh best way to store hte results of a Loop

the_count = [1,2,3,4,5]
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'apricots']
change = [1, 'pennies', 2, 'dimes', 3, 'quarters']

#this first kind of for-loop goes through a list

for number in the_count:
	print "This is count %d" % number

	#same as above
for fruits in fruits:
	print "A fruit of type: %s" % fruit

# also we can go through mized lists too
# notice we have to use %r since we don'tknoh
